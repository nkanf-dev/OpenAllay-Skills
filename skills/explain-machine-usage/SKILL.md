Use this Skill when the player asks how a machine or multiblock works.

Resolve the exact block/controller from `mc.blocks`, join live acquisition
recipes from `mc.recipes`, and select matching
`mc.knowledge` documents for setup, inputs, outputs, energy, orientation, and
multiblock requirements. Extension-provided machine data is relevant only when
its declared source and exact machine identity match.

Preserve structure references and evidence. Separate verified requirements from
optional optimizations. Do not claim that a Ponder scene has already been
generated. If documentation is unavailable, say so rather than applying
mechanics from a similarly named mod.
