Resolve the natural/localized name against registry IDs, aliases, and display
names, then filter `mc.recipes` by exact inputs and outputs. Correlate
`mc.recipeCatalog.providers`, diagnostics, and groups before concluding
absence. Search `mc.knowledge` for
progression changes, disabled recipes, alternate machines, quest gates, or
replacement items.

Return the observed matching recipes, relevant diagnostics, and exact
sourceId/generation/recipeId handles. Do not infer that a recipe exists from
documentation when the active recipe catalog does not contain it.
If one materially corrected analysis remains empty or partial, report the
limitation and stop.
